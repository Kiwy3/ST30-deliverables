\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

On a sequential comparaison, BO-GP algorithms is the most efficient between theses 3 algorithms, even considering the exploitation made by BamSOO algorithms. But this kind of performance needs to efficiently scale to be able to be usable with very expensive function, especially if the evaluation can't be distributed. 

With it's acceleration using GP, BaMSOO keep most of the SOO abilities, in particular it's parallelism inate abilities, but achieve to be efficient with a smaller number of evaluation. 

To be able to effectively compare theses approaches, it's necessary to look at higher dimensionnal problem.
